        There are two types of non-interest bearing RWA products. The basic non-interest bearing RWA products include entertainment works such as games, films, animations, and music. Published by creators, viewed and interacted with by entertainers. They are closely linked to the rights of celebrity groups to be mutually entertained, the social rights of individuals, and the rights to an economic premium for the work. Limited edition holographic RWA works, is including the release of secondary creations, peripheral products, and derivative works, such as publishing the limited edition NFT decks related to an IP, social media entertainment, and other rights related to the work, etc..

        We will distribute multiple non-interest bearing RWA products for cultural and entertainment work, targeting Web3 cultural and entertainment users as well as traditional cultural and entertainment users. The circulation of each interest bearing RWA product ranges from 10000 to 100000, with each sheet having an independent 6-digit code for players to freely choose from, and displaying the first time the RWA was minted. The main entertainment benefits included in non-interest bearing RWA products will have a locking mechanism. When you use this benefit, the non-interest bearing RWA will be locked in your wallet and cannot be circulated in the secondary market. This mechanism solves the problem of sluggish market value growth, inability to issue additional shares, and sustained operation of NFTs that occurred in the previous bull market. It brought the entertainment industry into the Web3 market, which was a three-year bull market where NFTs brought painters into Web3 and new players. Compared to the painting industry, the entertainment industry will have a market size and customer base
        of 1000-10000 times.
